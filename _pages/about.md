Hi, I'm Charlotte! I'm a DPhil student at the University of Oxford under Prof. Xiaowen Dong and Prof. Michael Bronstein, researching graph neural networks. I joined the AIMS CDT programme in 2024, and before that I completed my Masters in statistical science and an undergraduate degree in computer science and maths. I developed separate interests in machine learning, topology, and geometry and I'm now looking to combine these interests in the field of GNNs :)
